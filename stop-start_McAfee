The McAffee antivirus agent prevents any boot SW updates from installing correctly. To install them
it must be stopped, and then restarted after the install.

To check the status of the antivirus:

sudo /opt/McAfee/ens/tp/init/mfetpd-control.sh status
sudo /opt/McAfee/ens/esp/init/mfeespd-control.sh status

If it is running then stop the services with these:

sudo /opt/McAfee/ens/tp/init/mfetpd-control.sh stop
sudo /opt/McAfee/ens/esp/init/mfeespd-control.sh stop

Install software. If really foobar may need to:
sudo apt --fix-broken install

sudo /opt/McAfee/ens/esp/init/mfeespd-control.sh start
sudo /opt/McAfee/ens/tp/init/mfetpd-control.sh start
