# After much hand wringing decided to build TBB from the github repository. Intel just wanted to
# bundle too much shit in their runtime.
#

cd /software
# Clone oneTBB repository
git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB.git
cd oneTBB
# Create binary directory for out-of-source build
mkdir build && cd build
# Configure: disable TBB_TEST to avoid tests build
cmake -DTBB_TEST=OFF ..
# Build
cmake --build .
# Install
sudo cmake --install .
