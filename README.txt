How to install Arrow. Note that I wrote this after stumbling through it, so if starting again from
Scratch, there may need to be some tweaks to this procedure.

Captured the installation of various tools. This order seems to work.

1) install wget
2) gcc update to v8
3) openssl update
4) curl update
5) git update
6) install cmake
7) install re2
8) install python3
9) install re2c
10) install ninja
11) Install Google Protocol Buffers
12) install llvm
13) install arrow
14) build arrow
14) test arrow

All of this is scripted. Run master_install_script. It will generate several log files.
