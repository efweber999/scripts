# How to create, mount, and unmount a RAM disk.
#

# First run htop to see how much RAM is available. Depending on total size don't use more than
# 85% - 90%.

htop

# Can run this script with correct size to create and mount RAM disk /mnt/ram
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$(mount | grep -o "/mnt/ram")" != "/mnt/ram" ]; then
  sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ram
  sudo mount -t ramfs -o size=1g ramfs /mnt/ram
  sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /mnt/ram
fi
mount | grep ram

# Here is a script to unmount the disk.
#!/bin/bash
sudo umount /mnt/ram
